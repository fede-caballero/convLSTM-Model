This Flow is used to convert MDV files generated by TITAN to NetCDF and back.

The main objective is to verify if it is possible to convert NetCDF generated by other applications to MDV.

This conversion is made to find out if other sources (diff from TITAN) of NetCDF files are capable of being viewed in TITAN interface.
